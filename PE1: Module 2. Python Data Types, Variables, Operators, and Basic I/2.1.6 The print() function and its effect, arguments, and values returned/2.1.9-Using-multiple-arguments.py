print("The itsy bitsy spider" , "climbed up" , "the waterspout.")

#There is one print() function invocation, but it contains three arguments. All of them are strings.
#The arguments are separated by commas. We've surrounded them with spaces to make them more visible, 
#but it's not really necessary, and we won't be doing it anymore.

#Two conclusions emerge from this example:
#1.a print() function invoked with more than one argument outputs them all on one line;
#2.the print() function puts a space between the outputted arguments on its own initiative.
